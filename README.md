This is an exercise I did as part of a course in C-programming. 

It remembers countries that have been added to it using the input "A Country" and adds up all medals recieved by that country. 

The input "A Finland" followed by "M Finland 1 2 5" would add 1 gold medal, 2 silver medals and 5 bronze medals to Finland. If "M Finland 0 0 1" was used afterwards, the program would understand to add the medals and report that there are now 6 bronze medals. 

The command "Q" quits the program properly.
